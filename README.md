Our group, Team Foodies, plans on making an application that will curate recipes for the consumer based on selected inputs. 

The user will put within our app what kind of food they want (Thai, Chinese, Mexican, etc.), flavors they relish (Tangy, Sweet, Sour, etc.), and price range. Once they select their options, we will run our created algorithm to parse and decide which unique recipes to curate for our user. The user will then be given a list of recipes with the ingredients needed, price range for each item, and how to make the meal.

We decided to make Mepp because we believe people, especially millennials, have trouble not only cooking, but figuring out what to make for everyday meals. Mepp will completely remove this hassle, saving people hundreds of hours yearly and completely change the way make meals.

But, all roles within the team are considered equal while we dedicate a team leader for each “scrum” or “learning lesson”.

## Collaboration Tool(s)

Our team plans on using Slack for the majority of communication, while using Trello for task delegation.


## Proposed Architecture

We haven’t gone too much in depth on our architecture for our app. What we do know is that we are going to design and develop an Android application. We are considering using many different software tools such as: Firebase, Android Studio, Twilio, as well as some sort of .csv/.txt file with recipes.
